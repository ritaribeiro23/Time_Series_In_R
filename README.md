# Time Series in R

The work developed in this repository was prepared in the scope of a course in Time Series and Prediction Models in the context of my Master's Degree. This work was developed back in 2018 and was paramount both for my education as a Data Scientist and my personal love for Time Series.

During this project I versed on several characteristics of a chosen Time Series as well as applicable models to produce data forecasts.

For this project, the Time Series chosen reflects the values of sales in e-commerce and mail house orders from January 2000 to December 2017. This data was obtained at the website of the United States Census Bureau [here](https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html#mrts), and reflect the monthly revenue generated in commerce made via electronic means, like Amazon and Ebay (amongst others), and sales made by catalog (the process analog to La Redoute in Portugal). For the sake of simplicity, I will be only refering as this time series as “e-commerce” or “ecm” (short for e-commerce).
